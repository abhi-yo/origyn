# Customizing Your Hero

## Change Text

**Headline:**
```tsx
<h1>Your New Headline</h1>
```

**Description:**
```tsx
<p>Your new description text here</p>
```

**Buttons:**
```tsx
<Button>Your Button Text</Button>
```

## Change Colors

Replace color classes:
- `bg-purple-500` → `bg-blue-500`
- `text-orange-900` → `text-gray-900`
- `border-white/20` → `border-black/20`

## Change Images

Find and replace the image URL:
```tsx
src="https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg"
```

## Change Links

Replace all placeholder links:
```tsx
href="/your-page"
```

## Change Fonts

The templates use Google Fonts. To change:

```tsx
import { YourFont } from "next/font/google";

const yourFont = YourFont({ subsets: ["latin"] });
```

Then apply:
```tsx
<h1 className={yourFont.className}>Headline</h1>
```

## Remove Features

Don't need something? Just delete that code block:
- Remove navigation - delete the `<nav>` section
- Remove buttons - delete the `<Button>` components
- Remove animations - delete animation-related code

That's all you need to know!
