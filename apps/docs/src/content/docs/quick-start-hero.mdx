# How to Use Your Hero Template

Follow these simple steps. No coding experience needed!

## Step 1: Create a Next.js Project

Open your computer's terminal (on Mac: press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal") and run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-website
```

When it asks questions, just press Enter for each one to use defaults.

Then go into your project folder:

```bash
cd my-website
```

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

Copy and paste this command into your terminal:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu lucide-react
```

Wait for it to finish (you'll see green text when done).

## Step 3: Create Your Hero File

1. Open your project in a code editor (VS Code is free and easy)
2. Find the `src` folder on the left
3. Inside `src`, create a new folder called `components`
4. Inside `components`, create a new file called `hero.tsx`
5. Paste the hero code you copied from our website

## Step 4: Add the Hero to Your Homepage

1. Open the file `src/app/page.tsx`
2. Delete everything in that file
3. Paste this simple code:

```tsx
import { HeroSerene } from '@/components/hero'

export default function Home() {
  return <HeroSerene />
}
```

**Note:** Change `HeroSerene` to match your hero name:
- Copied Serene Hero? Use `HeroSerene`
- Copied Serenity Hero? Use `HeroSerenity`
- Copied Warmth Hero? Use `HeroWarmth`
- Copied Etherea Hero? Use `HeroEtherea`

## Step 5: See Your Website

In the terminal, type:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

You should see your hero section! ðŸŽ‰

## Step 6: Customize the Text

Open `src/components/hero.tsx` and look for text in quotes:

**Change the headline:**
Look for the big text between `<h1>` and `</h1>` tags. Replace it with your text.

**Change the description:**
Look for smaller text between `<p>` and `</p>` tags. Replace it with your text.

**Change button text:**
Look for text inside `<Button>` tags. Replace it with your text.

## Step 7: Update Links

Look for `href="#"` in your code. Replace the `#` with your actual page links:

```tsx
href="/about"      // Links to your about page
href="/pricing"    // Links to your pricing page
href="/contact"    // Links to your contact page
```

## Step 8: Change Colors (Optional)

Find color codes like `bg-purple-500` or `text-blue-600` and replace them:

- `bg-blue-500` = blue background
- `bg-green-500` = green background
- `text-red-500` = red text
- `text-gray-900` = dark gray text

## That's It!

Your hero section is now live on your website. Every time you save changes in your code editor, the website updates automatically.

**Need help?** Most beginners struggle with:
- Making sure you're in the right folder (use `cd my-website`)
- Typos in file names (double-check spelling)
- Missing packages (just run the install command again)
